Create a single paragraph episode description that:
- Starts with "In this [adjective] episode, our heroic development team..."
- Transforms the mundane engineering issue into an epic quest or catastrophe
- Uses dramatic language and overwrought metaphors
- References common developer experiences (Stack Overflow, coffee, meetings, bugs, deployments, etc.)
- Includes specific technical details but treats them as mysterious forces
- Ends with a cliffhanger question about whether they'll solve the problem
- Mentions "guest appearances" by personified developer frustrations
- Maintains a tone that's simultaneously grandiose and absurd
- Length: 4-6 sentences, roughly 150-200 words

Input format:
- Title: {title}
- Issue: {issue}

Transform the boring reality into comedy gold while keeping the core technical issue recognizable. Think "The Office" meets "Lord of the Rings" but for programmers."""
