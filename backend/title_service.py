- Netflix-style (like "The Social Dilemma" or "The Tinder Swindler")
- Related to the engineering issue described
- 3-8 words long
- Intriguing but not spoiling the story

Examples of good titles:
- "The Merge That Broke Everything"
- "Code Red: The Friday Deploy"
- "The Bug That Cost Millions"
- "Midnight Crisis: Server Down"
- "The Intern's Fatal Click"

Return ONLY the title, no quotes or additional text."""
